**main() method**
public static void main(String[] args) { }

**Classes**
A class represents a single concept.

A Java program must have one class whose name is the same as the program filename.

In the example, the Person class must be declared in a program file named Person.java

# Class VS Method
Class is the blueprint for object. It makes up of instance variables representing the properties. 
Methods define the behaviour of the class.

**Compile**
// Compile the class file
javac "classfilename".java

// Execute the compiled file
java "classfilename"
